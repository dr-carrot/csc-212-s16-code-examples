# C++ BootCamp

Welcome to the URI C++ CSC212 Boot Camp!

To get started, make an account at [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-c-microsoft-dev210x-0).
We will use this free course as an introduction to C++. The course has four modules which you should
watch prior to the first Boot Camp (2/8).  This material will give you a foundation for some of the trickier
aspects of C++ that we will be going over.

All Boot Camp sessions will be held in **Tyler 055**.  
Make sure to bring your laptop because we will be writing code!
