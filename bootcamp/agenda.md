# C++ BootCamp

Welcome to the URI C++ CSC212 Boot Camp!

To get started, make an account at [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-c-microsoft-dev210x-0)
We will use this free course as an introduction to C++.  The material here will complement
what we do in the Boot Camp, so you are expected to review this before attending!


Once you enroll in the C++ online course, you may need to watch Module 0 to know how
the website works.

# Session 1  (TBA @ Tyler Computer Lab 055)

## Watch edX Modules 1 and 2 before the camp!

During this session we will focus on:

- general structure of a C++ program (header files, prototypes, etc.)
- variables (naming, etc.)
- types (bool, etc.)
- functions (syntax, rules, etc.)


# Session 2

## Watch edX Modules 3 and 4 before the camp!
